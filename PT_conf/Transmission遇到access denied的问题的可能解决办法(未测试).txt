Assuming the path to the download folder is /home/chen/TV shows, run the following:

add chen to the debian-transmission group：
	sudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission chen
change the folder ownership
	sudo chgrp debian-transmission /home/chen/TV\ shows
grant write access to the group
	sudo chmod 770 /home/chen/TV\ shows
Stop the deamon with
	sudo service transmission-daemon stop
有人说也可以这样终止：
	kill transmission-daemon systemctl stop transmission-daemon
The last thing to do is change the file creation mask, so that the downloaded files would be writeable by chen.
	sudo nano /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json
… and change "umask": 18 to "umask": 2. Hit Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.
Start the daemon with
	sudo service transmission-daemon start
有人说也可以这样启动：
	systemctl start transmission-daemon
